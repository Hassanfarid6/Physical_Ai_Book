## About This Book

This book serves as a comprehensive guide for advanced students, researchers, and engineers working on the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics. It provides practical knowledge on creating embodied AI systems that can intelligently interact with the physical world through humanoid robots.

The book follows a hands-on approach, with each module building on the previous ones to create a complete humanoid robot control system. Students will develop systems that bridge AI agents with physical robots, enabling sensorimotor learning and adaptive behaviors in real-world environments.

The content is aligned with industry practices and uses state-of-the-art technologies including ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac Sim to ensure students gain relevant skills for modern robotics development.
