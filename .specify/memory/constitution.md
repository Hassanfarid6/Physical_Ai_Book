# Physical AI Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Hands-On Learning First
Every concept is introduced with practical examples and exercises; readers must implement code or experiments before moving to theory; each chapter includes runnable code samples that demonstrate the concepts in action.
<!-- Rationale: Ensuring learners engage actively with material promotes deeper understanding and retention -->

### II. Beginner-Focused Accessibility
Complex topics broken into digestible concepts; Clear explanations without assuming extensive prior knowledge; Step-by-step tutorials guide users from basics to intermediate level.
<!-- Rationale: Making Physical AI accessible to a broader audience by removing unnecessary barriers -->

### III. Progressive Skill Building
Content sequenced from foundational to advanced concepts; Each chapter builds on previous knowledge; Prerequisites clearly stated for each section.
<!-- Rationale: Creating a solid foundation that supports continued learning growth -->

### IV. Interactive Documentation
Using Docusaurus for responsive, searchable documentation; Interactive code snippets and examples embedded throughout; Navigation designed for both linear reading and reference use.
<!-- Rationale: Providing a superior learning experience through modern documentation tools -->

### V. Real-World Application Focus
Examples drawn from actual physical AI use cases; Emphasis on practical implementation over theoretical exploration; Projects simulate real-world problems and solutions.
<!-- Rationale: Bridging the gap between academic knowledge and industrial application -->

### VI. Community-Driven Improvement
Feedback mechanisms built into documentation; Regular updates based on reader suggestions and evolving technology; Contributions welcomed from the community.
<!-- Rationale: Maintaining relevance and quality through collaborative improvement -->

## Technical Constraints and Requirements

Use Docusaurus as the primary documentation framework; All code examples tested and verified for accuracy; Deployment on static hosting platforms; Cross-browser compatibility for documentation.

## Content Development Workflow

Writing follows hands-on-first methodology; All examples must be runnable and tested; Peer review process for technical accuracy; Regular review cycles to update content based on field developments.

## Governance

All content must align with the core principles of accessibility and hands-on learning; Updates undergo testing to ensure examples still work; New content additions must follow the progressive skill building approach.
